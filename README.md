# LemonOS
i don't even consider this an OS, just me for the first time actually being able to build basic one.
<br>
im improving!
<br>ofcourse i watched some tutorials, googled alot on oswiki.
<br> but i did almost everything on my own.
<br>proud of it.
<br>Just posting it here to remember it, nothing else.
<br>it is called lemonOS cause i was drinking sparkling water with lemon , lol :)
